# KPR-verse Makeover — Plans Index

Master roadmap for the 10-plan rollout. Spec lives at
[`../specs/2026-04-27-kprverse-makeover-design.md`](../specs/2026-04-27-kprverse-makeover-design.md).

Each plan ships independently and produces working, testable software. The
site stays deployable after every plan.

## Status

| # | Plan | Status | Spec phase | Touches user-visible behavior? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation: cinematics overlays + theme tokens | ✅ shipped | 1 + 2 | Yes (subtle grain + scan-lines) |
| 2 | Scene-frame: SceneFrame / SceneScrollLock / MarqueeBand | ✅ shipped | 3 | No (lib only) |
| 3 | Boot terminal + kinetic-text primitives | ✅ shipped | 1 + 3 | No (lib only) |
| 4 | Hero two-beat — boot terminal → force graph | ✅ shipped | 4 | **Yes — major** |
| 5 | Home other scenes (metrics, featured, what-I-do, about-preview) | 🔜 next | 5 | Yes |
| 6 | About + projects-index restaging | ⏳ planned | 6 | Yes |
| 7 | Kinetic-only treatment: feed, contact, admin, playground | ⏳ planned | 7 | Yes (subtle) |
| 8 | Audio (ambient + UI sfx) + custom crosshair cursor | ⏳ planned | 8 | Yes |
| 9 | New easter eggs: shake gesture, Konami in boot, replay-intro | ⏳ planned | 9 | Yes (mobile) |
| 10 | QA pass: Lighthouse, Playwright smoke, theme matrix | ⏳ planned | 10 | No (verification) |

## How to pick up

1. Read the spec. Know what goal each plan serves.
2. Read the most recently shipped plan to understand the conventions
   (TDD, vitest globals, `await TestBed.configureTestingModule().compileComponents()`,
   per-task commits, typecheck-override per-lib).
3. Read this index. The "Plan N spec" column tells you which spec section
   to focus on.
4. Open the next plan's `.md` if it exists. If it doesn't, draft it using
   `superpowers:writing-plans`.

## Plan-by-plan briefing

### Plan 4 — Hero two-beat ✅ shipped

**Goal:** First user-visible payoff. Wire the boot sequence to the App
shell, restage the home hero with the two-beat (terminal → graph), add
HUD chrome around the force graph, apply `KineticHeading` and
`DecryptText` to the name + tagline, wrap each home section with
`[appSceneFrame]`.

**Shipped via commits 2bb383e → b5cf558 on 2026-04-29:**
- `apps/web/src/app/app.ts` / `app.html` — `@if (bootVisible())` boot overlay gated by `BootGuardService` + footer `replayIntroTriggered` handler + palette `Replay intro` command.
- `apps/web/src/app/pages/home/home.*` — hero `<h1>` swapped for `<app-kinetic-heading>`; kicker + tagline wrap `appDecryptText`; every section gains `appSceneFrame`; `heroReady` signal flips on intersect.
- `libs/features/hero-graph` — four corner brackets, signal-driven `NODES NN` readout, RAF-driven `FRAME NNNN` ticker (cancelled on destroy, hidden under reduced-motion).
- `libs/shared/ui/src/lib/footer/footer.*` — visible `~$ replay-intro` button emits new `replayIntroTriggered` output.
- `apps/web/project.json` — bumped `anyComponentStyle` budget to 8kb warn / 12kb error to fit the redesigned hero CSS.

**Plan doc:** [`2026-04-27-makeover-plan-4-hero-two-beat.md`](2026-04-27-makeover-plan-4-hero-two-beat.md).

### Plan 5 — Home other scenes

**Goal:** Restage scenes 2-5 of the home page. Every existing section
keeps its content, gains: kinetic heading, decrypt-text on labels,
`[appSceneFrame]` for intersection reveals, marquee band between scenes.
Enable `[appSceneScrollLock]` on the home root container at this point.

**Files:** `apps/web/src/app/pages/home/home.html` (heavy), `home.css`.

**Dependencies:** Plan 4.

### Plan 6 — About + projects-index restaging

**Goal:** Same treatment as the home page, applied to `/about` (3 scenes:
Identity / Stack / Off-grid) and `/projects` (1 featured panel + ARCHIVE
grid).

**Files:** `apps/web/src/app/pages/about/about.*`,
`apps/web/src/app/pages/projects/projects-index.*`.

**Dependencies:** Plan 5 (so the patterns are stable).

### Plan 7 — Kinetic-only treatment for remaining pages

**Goal:** Lighter treatment (no scroll-lock, no marquee bands) for
`/feed`, `/contact`, `/playground`, `/admin/*`. Section headers get
`DecryptText`; section bodies get `[appSceneFrame]` reveals.
Admin pages keep this minimal — they need to be productive.

**Files:** all the page components above.

**Dependencies:** Plan 6.

### Plan 8 — Audio + custom cursor

**Goal:** Add the optional layers — ambient drone (off by default) and
UI sound effects (off by default), both toggleable in the nav and gated
behind `prefers-reduced-motion`. Custom monospace crosshair cursor on
desktop only.

**New components/services:**
- `AmbientAudioService` (in `shared/cinematics`)
- `UiSoundService` (in `shared/cinematics`)
- `CrosshairCursor` directive (in `shared/cinematics`)
- Audio toggles in the nav

**Audio assets:** ambient drone (~30s seamless OGG loop, ~120KB) and a
small UI SFX library lazy-loaded on first toggle. The OGG loop itself is
out of scope — needs to be sourced or synthesized externally.

**Dependencies:** None (independent layer). Could ship before Plan 7 if
desired.

### Plan 9 — New easter eggs

**Goal:** Three more mobile-friendly admin entry points beyond the five
already shipped.

**New units:**
- `ShakeDetector` service (in `shared/cinematics`) — handles `DeviceMotionEvent`
  permission UX on iOS, fires on three shakes within 1.5s.
- Konami sequence trap inside `BootSequence` — `↑↑↓↓` on desktop or
  four-corner taps on mobile during the boot, jumps straight to the
  auth terminal.
- Footer `~$ replay-intro` target — calls `BootGuardService.reset()` then
  reloads. Doubles as a discovery moment for the boot animation.

**Dependencies:** Plan 4 (uses `BootGuardService`); Plan 8 is independent.

### Plan 10 — QA pass

**Goal:** Final verification.

- Lighthouse pass (target ≥85 on mobile).
- Playwright smoke: home loads, boot completes/skips, all 5 scenes
  reachable, force graph renders.
- Manual cross-device matrix: iPhone Safari, iPad, Pixel Chrome, desktop
  Chrome/Firefox/Safari.
- Theme matrix: all 4 themes don't break in any scene.
- iOS DeviceMotion permission UX sanity check.
- Bundle size check: initial JS still <700KB warn / <1MB error.

**Dependencies:** All prior plans.

## Conventions reminder for future sessions

- Lib generation: `npx nx g @nx/angular:lib --name=X --directory=libs/<scope>/X --buildable=true --unitTestRunner=vitest-angular --style=css --standalone=true --prefix=app --no-interactive`
- After generating, **rename the path alias** in `tsconfig.base.json` from
  the bare lib name to `@rahul-dev/<scope>-<name>`.
- After generating, **add the `typecheck` override** to `project.json`
  (see CLAUDE.md for why; copy the pattern from any existing lib).
- After generating, **delete the placeholder component** the generator
  creates and **replace `src/index.ts`** with a clean header comment.
- Test specs use vitest globals (no imports), `await
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({imports:[...]}).compileComponents()`.
- Each plan ships in one focused commit with a `Co-Authored-By`
  attribution and references to the plan + spec docs.
- All cinematic / kinetic effects must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
  and `aria-hidden` decorative content.
